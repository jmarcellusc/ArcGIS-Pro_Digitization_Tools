# ArcGIS Pro Digitization Tools - 
## Introduction

**Updates**: As of June 2024; I will start revising some script tools for ESRI's ArcGIS Pro. The major reason is code improvement and ESRI's introduction to Apache Engine (they also made changes with some of their libraries).


* **Geographic Data Tools.Zip** - Contains an ESRI Toolbox
	* Attribute Tools (Toolset)
	* Geospatial Tools (Toolset)

**NEW**: A cartographic neatline tool will be introduced, this to make cartographic map neatlines more correct and exact based on what I've seen with the USGS. My old and current tool works but requires improvement in corner point entry.

**PURPOSE**: Collection to aid and improve geospatial digitization applications. Made for ESRI's ArcGIS Pro as python scripts, utilizing various libraries to include *arcpy*. Create by <j.marcel.c>. Currently adding various other tools.

## Code Standard
The code in the toolkit is locked to protect the integrity and functionality of the tool. By ensuring that the core code remains unchanged, we can provide a consistent and reliable experience for all users. Locking the code helps prevent unauthorized modifications that could introduce errors or compromise the tool's effectiveness.

However, we understand the importance of transparency and collaboration. Therefore, the code is available upon request. This approach allows us to maintain the tool's integrity while also supporting the needs of users who may wish to review, learn from, or customize the code for their specific purposes. By controlling the distribution of the code, we can also provide support and ensure that any modifications are made responsibly.
