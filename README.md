# ArcGIS Pro Digitization Tools - 
## Introduction

**Updates**: As of June 2024; I will start revising some script tools for ESRI's ArcGIS Pro. The major reason is code improvement and ESRI's introduction to Apache Engine (they also made changes with some of their libraries).


* **Geographic Data Tools.Zip** - Contains an ESRI Toolbox
	* Attribute Tools (Toolset)
	* Geospatial Tools (Toolset)

**NEW**: A cartographic neatline tool will be introduced, this to make cartographic map neatlines more correct and exact based on what I've seen with the USGS. My old and current tool works but requires improvement in corner point entry.

**PURPOSE**: Collection to aid and improve geospatial digitization applications. Made for ESRI's ArcGIS Pro as python scripts, utilizing various libraries to include *arcpy*. Create by <j.marcel.c>. Currently adding various other tools.
